# GOT

A simple todo list implemented in go + templ + htmx + tailwind.

This is mostly just to get more familiar with the technologies involved.

[Spec](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) is located here.
The goal is to have everything implemented.

## Requirements

[Go](https://go.dev/) - Build simple, secure, scalable systems with Go

[Task](https://taskfile.dev/) - Task is a task runner / build tool that aims
to be simpler and easier to use than, for example, GNU Make.

## Running

```sh
task run
```
